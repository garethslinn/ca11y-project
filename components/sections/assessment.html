<h3>4.2 Alternatives to Traditional Assessment Methods</h3>

        <h4>4.2.1 Project-Based Assessments</h4>

        <h4>4.2.3 Collaborative Challenges</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Introduce team-based exercises or pair-programming sessions, which simulate real-world problem-solving in a supportive environment.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>4.2.4 Iterative Feedback</h4>
        <ul>
