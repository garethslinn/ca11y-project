### **🌟 Join Me in Creating Inclusive Recruitment Practices! 🌟**

Hello,

I’m **Gareth Slinn**, and I’m passionate about transforming the recruitment process to be more inclusive for individuals with neurological, cognitive, psychological challenges, and brain injuries. I’ve developed a set of draft guidelines aimed at enhancing inclusivity in hiring, and I need your help to bring this vision to life.
