## Runbook

A runbook provides step-by-step instructions for operating and maintaining the project. Below are the essential procedures for **Ca11y**.

### Running Locally

1. **Ensure Prerequisites are Installed**

    - **Git:** For cloning the repository.
    - **Node.js (Optional):** If using build tools or extensions like Live Server.

2. **Clone and Navigate to the Project**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ca11y.git
   cd ca11y
   ```

3. **Launch the Website**

    - **Using Live Server:**
        - Open the project in VS Code.
        - Install the Live Server extension if not already installed.
        - Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server."
    - **Manual Method:**
        - Open `index.html` directly in your web browser.

### Testing

1. **Accessibility Testing**

    - Use tools like [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) or [AXE](https://www.deque.com/axe/) to assess accessibility compliance.
    - Navigate the site using keyboard-only to ensure all interactive elements are reachable.
    - Test with screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) to verify content is announced correctly.

2. **Responsive Design Testing**

    - Resize the browser window or use browser developer tools to simulate different device viewports.
    - Ensure that the layout adjusts appropriately across various screen sizes.

3. **Functionality Testing**

    - **Theme Toggle:** Verify switching between dark and light modes.
    - **Font Size Adjustment:** Ensure the text scales correctly without breaking the layout.
    - **"Back to Top" Button:** Scroll down to trigger the button and click it to test smooth scrolling.

### Deployment

1. **Choose a Hosting Platform**

    - **GitHub Pages:** Ideal for static websites.
    - **Netlify or Vercel:** Offers advanced features like continuous deployment.

2. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**

    - **Push the Repository to GitHub:**

      ```bash
      git add .
      git commit -m "Initial commit"
      git push origin main
      ```

    - **Enable GitHub Pages:**
        - Go to the repository on GitHub.
        - Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**.
        - Select the source branch (e.g., `main`) and root directory.
        - Save and wait for the site to deploy.

3. **Deploy to Netlify or Vercel**

    - **Sign Up / Log In:** Create an account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
    - **Connect Repository:** Authorize access to your GitHub repository.
    - **Configure Settings:** Set the build command (if any) and the publish directory (`/` for static sites).
    - **Deploy:** Initiate the deployment and monitor the progress via the dashboard.

### Troubleshooting

1. **"Back to Top" Button Not Appearing**

    - **Check Scrollability:**
        - Ensure the page has enough content to scroll beyond 200px.
        - Add temporary placeholder content if necessary.
    - **Inspect Element:**
        - Use Developer Tools to verify if the button is present in the DOM.
        - Check if the `show` class is being added when scrolling.
    - **Console Errors:**
        - Open Developer Tools and look for any JavaScript errors that might prevent the script from executing.

2. **Theme Toggle Not Working**

    - **Verify JavaScript:**
        - Ensure the script handling the theme toggle is correctly placed and free of errors.
    - **Check CSS Variables:**
        - Confirm that CSS variables for themes are defined and applied appropriately.

3. **Font Size Adjustment Issues**

    - **Review JavaScript Logic:**
        - Ensure event listeners for font size buttons are correctly implemented.
    - **Check CSS Responsiveness:**
        - Make sure text scaling doesn't break the layout.

4. **Component Loading Failures (If Reintroduced)**

    - **Ensure Placeholders Exist:**
        - Verify that all `id` attributes in HTML match those referenced in JavaScript.
    - **Network Issues:**
        - Check if all component files are correctly linked and accessible.
    - **Console Logs:**
        - Look for warnings about missing placeholders or fetch errors.
